"""Screenshots from the in-game menu, and their way to Send Log (round 603).

Source (every host):
  1. The picture is the game's own surface (MetalHostView) drawn without waiting for the game's next frame, so none of BCD's own
     windows (menu, HUD, touch controls) is in it; only when the app has memory to spare; at most 2000 px on the long side, a JPEG,
     encoded and written off the main thread; kept in Documents/Screenshots (visible in Files).
  2. Photos is add-only: the permission asked is `.addOnly`, nothing reads the library, Info.plist has the add description and not the
     read one.
  3. A picture goes with a log only when the player picks "Send with the screenshot" in the comment dialog; the dialog says it is sent as
     it is; the choice is kept for that log only and is spent (or dropped when the log did not go); it is the picture taken during that
     log's session; LogUpload.attach has one caller.
  4. The upload: its own route, a JPEG of 160 KB at most (the intake's limit), after the log, under the log's code; whatever happens to it is
     a note and never undoes the log's success; the answer says how it went.
  4b. What is uploaded is a small copy made apart from the kept picture (BCDScreenshotShrink: 1280 px at quality 0.75 down to 640 px at 0.4,
     stopping at the first copy of 100 KB or less), logged with its size and dimensions; the kept picture (Files, Photos) keeps its size
     (4 MB cap, as before). The words under the choice and the Settings footer say it is a small copy.
  5. The intake (bcd-logs/worker): POST /v1/shots, its admin routes, a budget of its own; its node tests pass.
  6. tools/pull-logs.py saves each picture beside its log, only from a whole JPEG, with a name made of validated codes, removes it from the
     bucket only when it is on the Mac, and copes with an intake that has no such route yet (run against a fake bucket).
  7. CI runs this check.

"""exe-window-auto and pool-above-window: the JIT pool around a large fixed-address program (StikJITHelper.swift, ContentView.swift).

A game whose main program has its relocations stripped can only run at 0x140000000, in the executable window. The window is
128 MB; a larger program (The Adventures of Elliot's Elliot-Win64-Shipping.exe, 473 MB; MapleStory.exe, 183 MB) overlapped the
JIT pool and failed to load with c0000018. BCD already widens the window from `exe-window-mb` in the game's own file (and
auto-tune adds that line after the failure). Two more things were ported, both OFF unless the game's file (or bcd.cfg) sets
them, because the games that run today have never been through them:
  - exe-window-auto = 1: a BCD Dock launch reads the PE headers of the programs in the game's folder
    (StikJITHelper.fixedBaseWindowMB) and widens the window to the largest fixed-address one, in 16 MB steps; an
    exe-window-mb of the game's own wins;
  - pool-above-window = 1: a `pool` line in the game's own file counts, and with pool-split the two runs above the window are
    paired also when the single pool would land above it (in the higher of two runs), with runs of 128 MB or more.

Checks:
  1. fixedBaseWindowMB, cut out of StikJITHelper.swift and run on synthetic folders of PE headers: the largest fixed-address
     64-bit program based in [0x140000000, 0x180000000) that ends above the 128 MB window sets the size (rounded up to 16 MB);
     relocatable programs, 32-bit programs, programs based elsewhere, programs that fit the window, other files, hidden folders
     and folders without a program give nothing; subfolders are read; only 4 KB of each file is read;
  2. the source: ContentView measures the folder only when the switch is on (and clears the value otherwise);
     allocatePool takes the value once and clears it, uses it only when the game's file names no exe-window-mb, and the size
     is capped at 960 MB; the pair above the window and the 128 MB run are gated by pool-above-window, the old test
     (a single run below the window, runs of 256 MB or more) stays for every other game; the game's pool line is read only with
     the switch.
Needs python3 and swiftc (--require-swift makes its absence a failure).

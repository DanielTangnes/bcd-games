"""DXMT's geometry/tessellation draw-argument marshal loops advance to the next task; a zero-size draw dispatches nothing.

madeira-bcd (build 623), the backport upstream Madeira took as willfaust/dxmt d811847f2 (3Shain/dxmt aadf0fb "add
missing increment in loop" and the zero-count guard of the same functions on 3Shain/dxmt main, issue #200).
gs_draw_arguments_marshal and ts_draw_arguments_marshal (src/dxmt/dxmt_command.metal) never incremented `index`. The host
sets end_of_command only on the last task, so a batch of two or more geometry or tessellation draws spun on tasks[0] until
the GPU timed out and the later tasks' dispatch arguments were never written (Dark Souls III froze in combat upstream). A
draw with zero vertices or instances underflowed (x - 1) and could ask for about 4G threadgroups. A batch of one draw, the
only kind that finishes today, takes the same path as before (end_of_command breaks before the new increment).

Reaches what CI compiles from DXMT's source: the 32-bit d3d10/d3d11 (the i386 farm's meson build) and the native library.
The 64-bit games' d3d11.dll is upstream's committed binary and keeps its own copy. Idempotent; fails by name if an anchor
moved. Run from the repository root.

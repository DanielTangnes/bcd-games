//  BCDFrameRing.h
//  Madeira
//
//  The frame-time ring: when each Present of the process happened, kept for the in-game HUD
//  (its frame-time graph and 1% lows) and the session summary (the [session] log line).
//
//  The present path calls bcd_frame_ring_push() once per Present (tools/patch-winemetal-frame-ring.py
//  puts the call into DXMT's winemetal, next to the present counter that madeira_get_present_count
//  reads). It is wait-free and costs one clock read, two relaxed atomics and one store: it never
//  allocates, locks, logs or looks at who is reading. It runs whether or not a HUD is shown, so a
//  session that ran without one still has its summary.
//
//  The readers are Swift (BCDHUDLive.swift, BCDSessionRecorderLive.swift) and the host check
//  (tests/host/check-bcd-hud.py, which compiles BCDFrameRing.c alone).
